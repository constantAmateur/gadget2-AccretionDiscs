  NEW COMPILE FLAGS
  INDIVIDUALAV = If set, the Cullen and Dehnen method is used to calculate the artificial viscosity.  If ARTVISCTEST is also set, both are calculated but the C & D method is used to actually evolve the particles.
  ARTVISCTEST = Calculate the artificial viscosity using the original method.  If INDIVIDUALAV is also set, the artificial viscosity will be calculated with both methods, but the C & D method will be used to evolve the particles.
  NEW PARAMETERS
  ArtViscDecayLength = The 'l' variable in setting the decay time for the artificial viscosity.
  ArtViscbparam = The 'b' parameter used to calculate Pi_ij.  Roughly equivalent to beta/alpha from the old method.
  AlphaMax = The maximum allowed value of the artificial viscosity.
