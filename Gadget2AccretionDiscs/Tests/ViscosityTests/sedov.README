The sedov test is taken from the following website, which also describes its initial conditions. http://www.astrosim.net/code/doku.php?id=home:codetest:hydrotest:standardsuite

The purpose of the test is to test the artificial viscosity and its ability to prevent inter-penetration and to correctly resolve the blast wave.  A periodic box is used.  The easiest way to analyse the results is to make use of the SPLASH built in solution for this problem.  First we need to shift the coordinate system of the output results, which is done with the python script shiftOrigin.py (it just shifts frame so the centre of the blast is at (0,0,0)).  When turning on the analytic solution in SPLASH, the density is 1.24e7 and the blast energy is 3.42e10 in code units...

The three movies to make are of the density, velocity (use the radial component, the others are approximately zero) and internal energy evolution with time.

On the website, the results they have look a lot "better" than the ones we have.  However, in order to achieve these nice looking results, I'm all but certain that they have aggresively tweaked the number of neighbours (i.e. reduced the smoothing in the density estimate) and ramped up the artificial viscosity.  This is all well and good, but I don't think it's fair to say "look how well we reproduce the analytic results" using values of the SPH parameters that you would never actually use in a real simulation where you did not know the results in advance.  Therefore, I have preferred to stick to parameters I will actually use and see if the agreement with the analytic result improves when you change to the more sophisticated artificial viscosity prescription.  Even this is a bit of a fiddle as the "more sophisticated" AV versions allow for a higher artificial viscosity than the standard GADGET version at the default settings, so the difference is likely driven by this.
