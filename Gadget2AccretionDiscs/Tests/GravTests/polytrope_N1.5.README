The starting point for this analysis is the polytrope_N1.5.IC file, which contains a settled equilibrium polytropic sphere, with index N=1.5 (which corresponds to gamma=5/3).  This polytrope is then perturbed as described in Price 2007 (the gravitational softening correction terms paper).  This perturbation is to set the radial velocity to be .2r, instead of being 0 as it is in the equilibrium configuration.

The point of this test is to follow the evolution of the total energy with the adaptive gravitational softening turned on, with and without the extra correction terms.  This should reproduce Figure 8 in the aforementioned paper.  After running the simulation, the code which does this analysis is in perturbed_poly_analysis.py and just does some basic plots with the energy.txt output files.
